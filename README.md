# Squash the Creeps in Godot 4 (C#) 

Squash the Creeps 3D is a free and open-source game demo for the [Your First 3D Game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/first_3d_game/) tutorial in the official Godot documentation.  
Unfortunately the documentation has not yet been updated to reflect changes made in the version 4 of the Godot Engine.  
Moreover the official [repo](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-3d-dodge-the-creeps) contains scripts written in GDScript, while this repo focuses on C#.  
As a person completely new to Godot I had to understand how to adapt the tutorial to the new Nodes and methods definitions. I hope this repo can be useful for other people learning Godot!
